- bntx reader (BCn/ASTC library?)
- convert existing format readers from object oriented design (i.e. more lazy loading kind of stuff, like SARC.read -> SARC.init + SARC.get_filename_by_idx + SARC.get_file_by_name etc)
- write more docs
- bfres reader
- szs reader
- rewrite yaz0 compression algorithm to not store every candidate

- byml
    - implement hash key binary search
    - compression ratio for saving. can reuse identical container nodes/special type nodes
    - less naive way of finding string idx in string table
    - support big endian
