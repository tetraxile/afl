Yaz0 compression file format


===== HEADER =====

offset | size | type    | description
-------+------+---------+--------------------------------------
0x00   | 0x04 | char[4] | signature "Yaz0"
0x04   | 0x04 | u32     | uncompressed file size (big endian)
0x08   | 0x04 | u32     | alignment (big endian)
0x0c   | 0x04 | u32     | padding


===== COMPRESSION =====

first, read one "code" byte. this byte's 8 bits will determine what to do
for the next 8 operations. read the bits from most significant to least
significant. if a bit is 1, copy one byte directly from the input to the
output buffer. if the bit is 0, compressed data is ahead. read 2 bytes as
follows:

     byte 1     |    byte 2
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7|0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
| count |         offset        |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

count: 4 bits
  number of bytes to read.
  if count is 0, then read third byte and add 0x12 to it to get the count.
  otherwise, just add 2.

offset: 12 bits
  offset from write pointer in output buffer to read from.
  add 1 to this value.


subtract `offset` from the write pointer in the output buffer, and then
copy `count` bytes from there to the end of the output buffer.

note: `count` may be larger than `offset`, meaning the copy source and
destination overlap.

note: not all 8 bits of the "code" byte need to be used. if the write
pointer exceeds the specified uncompressed file size, any remaining bits
of the current code byte will be skipped.

info: `count` only starts at 3 because a compressed chunk of `count` 2 or
less would take more bytes than just copying due to the 2 bytes of info
for compressed data.
